# Customer Churn Prediction using PySpark

This project demonstrates how to build a machine learning model to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company using PySpark.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to identify key factors that contribute to customer churn and provide actionable insights to reduce churn and improve customer retention. This end-to-end project includes tasks such as:

1. Data loading
2. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
3. Data preprocessing
4. Feature preparation
5. Model training and evaluation
6. Model deployment

## Prerequisites
Before starting this project, you should have:

1. Basic understanding of Machine Learning concepts (Decision Trees, Classification)
2. Familiarity with Python programming (loops, if statements, lists)
3. Working knowledge of PySpark.

## Project Structure

* data/: Contains sample datasets used for training and testing.
* notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks that walk through the project.

## Key Steps

1. **Data Loading & Exploration:** Load customer data and perform initial exploratory analysis.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean the data, handle missing values, and perform transformations.
3. **Feature Preparation:** Engineer features and prepare them for modeling.
4. **Model Training:** Train the model using PySpark’s machine learning libraries.
5. **Evaluation:** Evaluate the model’s performance using accuracy, precision, recall, etc.
6. **Deployment:** Demonstrate how to deploy the model and generate predictions.

## Results

The model provides insights into customer behavior, allowing the company to take targeted actions to reduce churn and improve retention rates.
